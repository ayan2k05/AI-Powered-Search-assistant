## Overview

This Voice Assistant is a project created by Ayan Pathan. It serves as a demonstration of our skills in AI, NLP, and data extraction. While the assistant might seem simple, it is an outcome of our enthusiasm for exploring the intersection of technology and natural language processing.

## Project Motivation

To be honest, i just wanted to create an effective extraction tool and a main context extractor from Google and Wikipedia searches. I chose to use GPT-Neo since we do not have access to an API key for GPT-3 or GPT-4.

## Features

- Extracts and summarizes information from Google and Wikipedia searches.
- Uses GPT-Neo for generating AI-driven responses.
- Capable of voice interactions using `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech.
- Demonstrates basic TensorFlow computations.
